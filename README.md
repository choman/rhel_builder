# Docker RHEL builder

This project was spawned out of necessity to create a base
image for RHEL 6.7.  Since then it's been tested with 
RHEL 6.9 and 7.4.

## USAGE

### Build

fire off the build script ./build.sh

### Run

First we need ISO data and currently only mounting an ISO works.
1. so mount the ISO to /mnt
2. once mounted, exeecute the run script ./run.sh


## TODO - coming soon
